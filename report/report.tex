\section{Perform a precise analysis of the time complexity of the Flooding algorithm.}
\subsection{The synchronous model}

The \textit{distance} between two nodes $u, v$ in an undirected graph is the number of hops of a minimum path between $u$ and $v$. The \textit{radius} of a node $u$ in a graph is the maximum distance between $u$ and any other node. The radius of a graph is the minimum radius of any node in the graph. The \textit{diameter} of a graph is the maximum distance betwen two arbitrary nodes. 

In the synchronous model, process execution speeds and message delivery delays are upper-bounded by a fixed $k$.

If node $v$ receives the message first from node $u$, then node $v$ calls node $u$ \textit{parent}. This parent relation defines a spanning tree $T$. 

In every execution of the broadcast algorithm in the synchronous model, every process at distance $t$ from $p_r$ in the spanning tree receives $M$ in round $t$. 

THe number of rounds needed to reach all nodes: the diameter of $G$.

By induction on the distance $t$ of a process from $p_r$. 

$t = 1$. Each child of $p_r$ receives $M$ from $p_r$ in the first round.
Assume that every process at distance $t - 1 \geq$ from $p_r$ receives $M$ in round $t - 1$. 

Let $p$ be any process at distance $t$ from $p_r$. Let $p'$ be the parent of $p$ in the spanning tree. Since $p'$ is at distance $t - 1$ from $p_r$, by the induction hypothesis, $p'$ receives $M$ in round $t - 1$. By the description of the algorithm, $p$ receives $M$ from $p'$ in the next round.

Every processor receives $M$ after at most $D$ time and at most $|E|$ messages, where $D$ is the diameter of the network, and $E$ is the set of (directed) edges in the network. Proof is by induction.

Let $d(root, v) = k > 0$. Then $v$ has a neighbour $u$ such that $d(root, u) = k - 1$. By the induction hypothesis, $u$ receives $M$ for the first time no later than time $k - 1$. $u$ sends $M$ to all its neighbours, including $v$ at $k$, so $M$ arrives at $v$ no later than time $(k - 1) + 1 = k$.

Each process only sends $M$ to its neighbours once, so each edge carries at most one copy of $M$. The message complexity is therefore $|E|$.

\subsection{The asynchronous model}

In asychronous systems the flooding algorithm terminates after $R$ time units, where $R$ is the radius is the source. However, the constructed spanning tree may not be a breadth-first search spanning tree. 

In every execution of the broadcast algorithm in the asynchronous model, every process at distance $t$ from $p_r$ in the spanning tree receives $M$ in 

\section{Consider an anonymous ring where processors start with binary inputs.}

\subsection{Give an argument that there is no uniform synchronous algorithm for computing the AND of the input bits.}

Proof is by contradiction. Assume that there is an uniform synchronous algorithm $A$ that computes AND. Assume a ring where all inputs are $1$. In any round $i$ the states of all processors are identical, and these states do not depend on the size $n$ of the ring, as the algorithm is uniform. As $A$ is correct, there must exist a round $t$ such that all processors terminate and output $1$.

Now run $A$ on a ring of size $2(t + 1)$, with $1$ processor $p$ with input $0$ and $2t + 1$ processors with input $1$. $p$ disseminates $0$. However, the processor 'opposite' $p$ will not receive $0$ by round $t$; it will instead terminate and output $1$. This contradicts the assumption that $A$ is correct (in which case $0$ should be output at all processors).  

\subsection{Present an asynchronous (non-uniform) algorithm for computing the AND. The algorithm should send $O(n^2)$ messages in the worst-case.}

Let $n$ be the number of processors. Each processor sends a message to its right neighbour and waits for messages from its left neighbour. Each message $m$ comprises a counter $hop = 0$ and a state $x$. $hop$ is incremented every time $m$ is sent. If $m.hop == n$, the message has arrived where it started. 

When a processor $p$ with input state $x$ receives a message $m$, it updates $m.x = p.x \land m.x$. It then checks $m.hop$. If $m.hop < n$, it forwards the message to the right. If $m.hop == n$, the processor terminates. 

As each processor sends a message, and each message makes $n$ hops, the message complexity is $O(n^2)$.

\subsection{Present a synchronous algorithm for computing the AND. The algorithm should send $O(n)$ messages in the worst case.}

Let $n$ be the number of processors. A processor with an initial state of $0$ sends a message in both directions and halts (in state $0$). A processor with an initial state of $1$ waits for $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ cycles. If it receives a message during that period, then it forwards it and halts in state $0$. If by cycle $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ a processor has not received any message, it halts in state $1$. The total number of messages sent is $O(n)$.
